Your theory explains perfectly why:\n\n1. Converting the groupby result to a list first fails - because by the time we try to access the child iterators, the parent has already advanced past all the data\n2. Your generator expression approach works - because we're processing each child iterator completely (via `list(v)`) before moving to the next group in the parent iterator\n3. The immediate for-loop approach worked - for the same reason as #2\n\nThis is a really interesting example of how iterators in Python can have dependencies on their parent iterator's state.
