Also, I notice the antindoes do not always appear on the antennas generating them, despire that a distance of 0 would produce this effect.\n\nSo it seems to me that they intend \"exactly in line\" to have a specific meaning. Perhaps they mean that antinodes appear at the grid positions produced by reproducing the exact integer multiples that separate the original antennas.
