Advent of Code 2024

This repo is mainly for sharing work on Advent of Code 2024, associated with the Answer.AI 2024 SolveIt course at https://solveit.fast.ai.

The point of this course is to teach problem-solving methods, in concert with AI, inspired by Polya's book *How to Solve It*, and not programming as such.

So _these notebooks do NOT represent optimized solutions of AOC 20224 problems_. Go elsewhere for that.

They are intended as more or less faithful records of live problem-solving sessions, so they show blind alleys, getting stuck, looking up documentation, using AI for assistance, etc..

A couple of these I have lightly annotated after the session, with *After-analysis* which is discussion of the problem itself (the object level, if you will) and also *Meta-analysis*, which is post-mortem on the application of the problem-solving method.
